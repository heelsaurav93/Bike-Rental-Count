# Bike-Rental-Count

A bike rental service is a system which allows users to rent bicycles and use them for a particular period of time. These bikes can be picked up from any particular “dock” and can then be returned at any other dock belonging to the same system. Users can typically purchase a service using an app on their phones and make the payment. They can use them for travelling to their work, hiking, road trips etc. This holds some advantages over using motorized vehicles like motorbikes, cars or buses, in that air and noise pollutions are reduced. It also leads to less congestions on the roads leading to much less traffic. As a result, people are able to reach their destinations much smoother and more efficiently. According to Wikipedia, roughly about 1000 cities worldwide have a bike-sharing program. Behind-the-scenes, the organizations running these bike-renting services have a lot on their plates, so to speak. The ability to predict the daily counts can certainly be beneficial to them in the long run, allowing them to manage their businesses in a more proficient and cost-effective fashion. This is the goal of the project, i.e., to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the daily bike rental count depending on the weather and certain seasonal or environmental conditions.
